# Natural Modelling


This repository groups together some projects based around _Neural Networks_, _Genetic Algorithms_, _Natural Language Processing_ and whatever else I feel fits into the category of **Natural Modelling**


The basic premise is that all included sub-projects are concerned with modelling naturally ocurring phenomena, and mostly these projects serve little more than academic curiosity.
