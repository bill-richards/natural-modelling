# Welcome to GSDC's Natural Modelling

This repository groups together some projects based around _Neural Networks_, _Genetic Algorithms_, _Natural Language Processing_ and whatever else I feel fits into the category of _**Natural Modelling**_: that is, computationally modelling concepts, theories, and objects from the world around us.

The basic premise is that all included sub-projects are concerned with modelling naturally ocurring phenomena, and mostly these projects serve little more than to satisfy academic curiosity.

### _Nota bene_

Whenever commits are made to the repository, GitHub Pages willl run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in this site, from the content in the Markdown files, and therefore this documentation should always be up to date.
