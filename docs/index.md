# Welcome to GSDC's Natural Modelling


This repository groups together some projects based around _Neural Networks_, _Genetic Algorithms_, _Natural Language Processing_ and whatever else I feel fits into the category of _**Natural Modelling**_: that is, computationally modelling concepts, theories, and objects from the world around us.


The basic premise is that all included sub-projects are concerned with modelling naturally ocurring phenomena, and mostly these projects serve little more than academic curiosity.

Whenever commits are made to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in the site, from the content in the Markdown files.

## Getting the source

Because some of the solutions in this repository have dependencies on other libraries, those libraries (which can be) are included as submodules. When you get the source, be sure to also call the following

```
$ git submodules update --init --recursive
```


### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/bill-richards/natural-modelling/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
